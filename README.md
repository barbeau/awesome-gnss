### Proprietary tools

- [Jason Positioning-as-a-Service](https://jason.rokubun.cat) An online service
that allows you to upload your GNSS data in various formats (Rinex, ublox files,
GNSS logger files, ...) and process it using Post-processing Kinematic (PPK) strategy. The service
will automatically pick a nearby reference receiver.
